[jeffmancilla.github.io/mid-typing-game](https://jeffmancilla.github.io/mid-typing-game/) (deployed with GitHub Pages)

The player must type out falling words that appear on the screen. 
Player wins when all words have been typed out of the screen, and loses when a word falls into the typing line.

Remember to browse through the options menu to set different word categories and difficulty settings!

## Future Enhancements

- Remove the need for the player to press enter, space or tab / per-key character matching
- Allow winning players to keep playing on a higher difficulty and adding on top of their current score (level system)
- Expose timers and other game mechanics in the options menu, allowing for more ways to dial in game difficulty
- A combo meter!
- Switch out of Elden Ring soundboard audio assets
- Logo for the game (add to title screen)
