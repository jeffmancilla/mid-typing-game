## glow snippet -- a piece of your project you are most proud of, but want to improve

Event Handlers, Listeners: this project and unit really helped demystify JS+DOM for me! I'm not sure if having one or few *big* listeners is better than many *smaller* listeners, but I'd be curious to learn more about this kind of stuff.

## grow snippet - a piece of code that works but maybe is still a bit tricky/buggy

array shallow copies! my INIT_STATE object has some array properties that, when assigned to the state variable via spread operator, do not behave normally. what the heck! Jan gave me some good resources about this topic that and I somewhat get the idea that the state object array property is merely a reference to the INIT_STATE's array.
